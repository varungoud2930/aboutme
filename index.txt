I’m new joiny to the Northwest Missouri State University for Spring 2019 batch, working on my Masters of “Applied Computer Science”. I am interested towards the computer languages like JAVA,.NET, MY-SQL and etc..

I Born and Bought up in Hyderabad, Capital of Telangana one of the developing State in India. I completed my first degree there in GURU NANAK INSTITUTION OF TECHNICAL CAMPUS-affiliated to JAWAHARLAL NEHRU TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY. And at the starting I was very keen to learn my courses which I was not at all familiar like Signals and Systems, Circuits, Mathematics and many more. But later on i.e. after studying this subjects I became intense to this subjects. By this I started helping in clarifying doubts to my juniors in this particular courses. I participated in many events which held in our college in all the Semesters. I want to enhance my few programming skills and eagerly awaited for the new courses in my Masters which would help me to get a better job. And I’m much interested in playing Cricket as well as Dancing.

One of the main reason for pursuing masters is to see myself as a one of the top most Software Developer or Programmer. My dream job is Full Stack Developer in Wipro. Even we will be doing the coding part in the company which is quite similar to the courses which I am pursuing in my masters Degree. So I’ll definitely prove myself to the maximum standards. Basically I’m a hard worker, so its quite simple to achieve my goals.
